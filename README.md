# Is DiMsHiK Drinking coffee right now ?


This is a fun "One day" project i did to present the coffee intake data i'm collecting about myself.

The data is based on **693** cups of coffee i drank over a period of one a few years, from 2015-10-11 to 2018-03-11.

I'm a big fan of DATA so i wear [Samsung gear s2 (classic)](http://www.samsung.com/global/galaxy/gear-s2/) and log coffee cups i drink.

There is also a Node.js script on the [master](https://github.com/dimshik100/Am-i-drinking-coffee-right-now/tree/master) branch to convert the exported `CSV` from Samsung health to a simple `JSON` file for this client app. 

Made with lots of ☕️

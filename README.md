# Is DiMsHiK Drinking coffee right now ?


This is a fun "One day" project i did to present the coffee intake data i'm collecting about myself.

The data is based on **2816** cups of coffee i drank over a period of a few years, from 11/10/2015 to 08/10/2022. (OMG üò≤, 7 years already)

I'm a big fan of DATA so i wear [Samsung gear s2 (classic)](http://www.samsung.com/global/galaxy/gear-s2/) and ~~log coffee cups i drink.~~ no longer log the data using my watch, as the coffee logging functionality was removed from samsung health a couple of versions ago.

I log them using a shortcut to google spreadsheet on my mobile. (It's a 3 tap process to log a cup of coffee)

The google spreadsheet is public and I pull live data from it to this project using the cool open source [opensheet](https://github.com/benborgers/opensheet) by [Ben Borgers](https://github.com/benborgers)

~~There is also a Node.js script on the [master](https://github.com/dimshik100/Am-i-drinking-coffee-right-now/tree/master) branch to convert the exported `CSV` from Samsung health to a simple `JSON` file for this client app.~~

Made with lots of ‚òïÔ∏è
